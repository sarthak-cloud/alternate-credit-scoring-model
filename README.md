Alternative Credit Scoring Model

**Hackathon Project | Team of 5**

---

##  Problem Statement

Traditional credit scoring models heavily rely on formal credit history, which excludes millions of individuals who may still be creditworthy. This project explores an **alternative credit scoring system** using non-traditional data sources such as rent payments, utility bills, education levels, cash flows, and employment status to help include the "credit invisible" population in financial systems.

---

## 📊 Dataset

Since public alternative credit datasets are limited, we simulate realistic applicant profiles using features like:

- Monthly rent payments
- Utility bill payment history
- Education level
- Monthly cash inflow and outflow
- Employment status (e.g., employed, self-employed, unemployed)

> 📁 Generated in `data/simulated_credit_data.csv` using `simulate_data.py`
